The court shall have a regular basketball playing court sized zone, including a free throw line (5.80 m), a 2-point line (6.75m) and a "no-charge semi-circle" area underneath the basket.

At grassroots level, 3x3 can be played anywhere; court makings - if any are used - shall be adapted to available space, however FIBA 3x3 Official Competitions must fully comply with the above specifications including backstop with the shot clock integrated in the backstop padding.

Lines
All lines shall be of the same colour and drawn in white or other contrasting colour, 5 cm in width and clearly visible.

Boundary line/Boundary area
The playing court shall be limited by the boundary line, consisting of the baseline (behind the basket), endline (opposite the basket) and the sidelines. These lines are not part of the playing court.

There shall be an additional boundary area of 1 m at the endline, 1.5 m at the sidelines (exceptionally for matters of limited space a minimum of 1 m) and 2 m at the baseline around the playing court.

The scorer's table and its chairs must be placed behind the endline on the lefthand side (when facing the basket).


Free-throw line, restricted area and free-throw rebound places
The free-throw line shall be drawn parallel to the baseline and endline. It shall have its furthest edge 5.80 m from the inner edge of the baseline and shall be 3.60 m long. Its mid-point shall lie on the imaginary line joining the mid-point of the endline and baseline.

The restricted area shall be the rectangular area marked on the playing court limited by the baseline, the extended free-throw line and the lines which originate at the baseline, its outer edges being 2.45 m from the mid-point of the baseline and terminating at the outer edge of the extended free-throw line. These lines, excluding the baseline, are part of the restricted area.


2-point field goal area
The teams' 2-point field goal area shall be the entire floor area of the playing court, except for the area inside the arc, limited by and including:

* The 2 parallel lines extending from and perpendicular to the baseline, with the outer edge 0.90 m from the inner edge of the sidelines.

* An arc of radius 6.75 m measured from the point on the floor beneath the exact centre of the basket to the outer edge of the arc. The distance of the point on the floor from the inner edge of the mid-point of the baseline is 1.575 m. The arc is joined to the parallel lines.

The 2-point line (the arc) is not part of the 2-point field goal area.

No-charge semi-circle area
The no-charge semi-circle area shall be marked on the playing court, limited by:

* A semi-circle with the radius of 1.25 m measured from the point on the floor beneath the exact centre of the basket to the inner edge of the semi-circle. The semi-circle is joined to:

* The 2 parallel lines perpendicular to the baseline, the inner edge 1.25 m from the point on the floor beneath the exact centre of the basket, 0.375 m in length and ending 1.20 m from the inner edge of the baseline.

The no-charge semi-circle area is completed by imaginary lines joining the ends of the parallel lines directly below the front edges of the backboard

The no-charge semi-circle line is part of the no-charge semi-circle area.

Players: Injury
In the event of injury to a player(s), the referees may stop the game.

If the ball is live when an injury occurs, a referee shall not blow his whistle until the team in control of the ball has shot for a field goal, lost control of the ball, withheld the ball from play or the ball has become dead. If it is necessary to protect an injured player, the referees may stop the game immediately.

If the injured player cannot continue to play immediately (within approximately 15 seconds) or, if he receives treatment, he must be substituted.

Substitutes may enter the playing court, only with the permission of a referee, to attend to an injured player before he is substituted.

A doctor may enter the playing court, without the permission of a referee if, in the doctor's judgement, the injured player requires immediate medical treatment.

PLAYING REGULATIONS

Playing time, tied score and overtime
The regular playing time (in official competitions and the recommended one) shall be 1 period of 10 minutes. The game clock shall be stopped during dead ball situations and free throws.

There shall be the interval of play of 1 minute between the regular playing time and overtime.

An interval of play begins:
* When the player introduction starts (if any) but no later than when the players enter the playing court.
* When the game clock signal sounds for the end of the regular playing time if an overtime has to be played.
An interval of play ends:
* At the beginning of regular playing time or overtime when the ball is in the hands of the offensive player after the check-ball has been completed.

If the score is tied at the end of regular playing time, an overtime shall be played. The first team to score 2 points in the overtime wins the game.

If a foul is committed when or just before the game clock signal sounds for the end of the regular playing time, any eventual free throw(s) shall be administered after the end of the regular playing time.

If an overtime is required as a result of this free throw(s) then all fouls that are committed after the end of the regular playing time shall be considered to have occurred during an interval of play and the free throws shall be administered before the beginning of the overtime.

If a game clock is not available, the running time's length and/or required points for
"sudden death" is at the organizer's discretion. FIBA recommends setting the score limit in line with the game's duration (10 minutes/10 points; 15 minutes/15 points; 21 minutes/21 points).

Beginning and end of the game
Both teams shall warm-up simultaneously prior to the game.

A coin flip shall determine which team gets the first possession. The team that wins the coin flip can either choose to benefit from the ball possession at the beginning of the game or at the beginning of a potential overtime.

The game cannot begin if one of the teams is not on the playing court with 3 players ready to play. This article shall only apply to FIBA 3x3 Official Competitions.

The regular playing time or overtime begins when the ball is in the hands of the offensive player after the check-ball has been completed.

The regular playing time ends when the game clock signal sounds for the end of the regular playing time or a team reaches 21 or 22 points during regular playing time (sudden death), whatever happens first.

The overtime ends as soon as one team scores 2 or more points in overtime.

Status of the ball
The ball can be either live or dead.

The ball becomes live when:
* During a check-ball, the ball is at the disposal of the offensive player after the check-ball has been completed; after a check-ball the ball is live until a referee blows his whistle or the sound of game/shot clock signal.
* Following each successful field goal or last free throw.
* During a free throw, the ball is at the disposal of the free-throw shooter.

The ball becomes dead when:
* A referee blows the whistle while the ball is live.
* It is apparent that the ball will not enter the basket on a free throw which is to be followed by:
- Another free throw(s).
- A further penalty (free throw(s) and/or possession).
* The game clock signal sounds for the end of the regular playing time, sudden death or overtime.
* The shot clock signal sounds while a team is in control of the ball.
* The ball in flight on a shot for a field goal is touched by a player from either team after:
— A referee blows his whistle.
- The game clock signal sounds for the end of the regular playing time.
- The shot clock signal sounds.

The ball does not become dead and the goal counts if made when:
* The ball is in flight on a shot for a field goal and:
- A referee blows his whistle.
- The game clock signal sounds for the end of the regular playing time.
- The shot clock signal sounds.
* The ball is in flight on a free throw and a referee blows his whistle for any rule infraction other than by the free-throw shooter.
* The ball is in the control of a player in the act of shooting for a field goal who finishes his shot with a continuous motion which started before a foul is charged on any opponents' player or substitute.

This provision does not apply, and the goal shall not count if:
- After a referee blows the whistle and an entirely new act of shooting is made.
- During the continuous motion of a player in the act of shooting the game clock signal sounds for the end of the regular playing time or the shot clock signal sounds.

Location of a player and a referee
The location of a player is determined by where he is touching the floor.

While he is airborne, he retains the same status he had when he last touched the floor. This includes the boundary line, the arc, the free-throw line, the lines delimiting the restricted area and the lines delimiting the no-charge semi-circle area.

The location of a referee is determined in the same manner as that of a player. When the ball touches a referee, it is the same as touching the floor at the referee's location.

Jump ball situation
A held ball occurs when one or more players from opposing teams have one or both hands firmly on the ball so that neither player can gain control without undue roughness.

Jump ball situations
A jump ball situation occurs when:
* A held ball is called.
* The ball goes out-of-bounds and the referees are in doubt or disagree about which of the opponents last touched the ball.
* A double free-throw violation occurs during an unsuccessful last free throw.
* A live ball lodges between the ring and the backboard except:
- Between free throws,
- After the last free throw followed by a check-ball.
* The ball becomes dead when neither team has control of the ball nor is entitled to the ball.
* After the cancellation of equal penalties on both teams, if there are no other foul penalties remaining for administration and neither team had control of the ball nor was entitled to the ball before the first foul or violation.

Should a jump ball situation occur, the game shall be resumed with a check-ball for the last defensive team. The shot clock shall be reset to 12 seconds.

How the ball is played
Definition: During the game, the ball is played with the hand(s) only and may be passed, thrown, tapped, rolled or dribbled in any direction, subject to the restrictions of these rules.

Rule: A player shall not run with the ball, deliberately kick or block it with any part of the leg or strike it with the fist.

However, to accidentally come into contact with or touch the ball with any part of the leg is not a violation.

An infraction of Art. 13.2 (run with the ball, deliberately kick or block it with any part of the leg or strike it with the fist) is a violation.

Control of the ball
Definition: Team control starts when a player of that team is in control of a live ball by holding or dribbling it or has a live ball at his disposal.

Team control continues when:
* A player of that team is in control of a live ball.
* The ball is being passed between team-mates.

Team control ends when:
* An opponent gains control.
* The ball becomes dead
* The ball has left the player's hand(s) on a shot for a field goal or for a free throw.

Player in the act of shooting
Definition: A shot for a goal or a free throw is when the ball is held in a player's hand(s) and is then thrown into the air towards the basket.

A tap for a goal is when the ball is directed with the hand(s) towards the basket.

A dunk for a goal is when the ball is forced downwards into the basket with one or both hands.

A continuous movement on drives to the basket or other moving shots are an action of a player who catches the ball while he/she is progressing or upon completion of the dribble and then continues with the shooting motion, usually upwards.

The act of shooting:
* Starts when the player starts the continuous movement normally preceding the release of the ball and, in the judgement of a referee, he has started an attempt to score by throwing, tapping or dunking the ball towards the basket.
* Ends when the ball has left the player's hand(s), or if an entirely new act of shooting is made and, in case of an airborne shooter, both feet have returned to the floor.

The act of shooting in a continuous movement on a drive to the basket or other moving shot:
* Starts when the ball has come to rest in the player's hand(s), upon completion of the dribble or a catch in the air and the player begins the shooting motion preceding the release of the ball for a goal.
* Ends when the ball has left the player's hand(s), or if an entirely new act of shooting is made, and in case of an airborne shooter, both feet have returned to the floor.

There is no relationship between the number of legal steps taken and the act of shooting.

During the act of shooting, the player might have his/her arms) held by an opponent, thus being prevented from scoring. In this case it is not essential that the ball leaves the player's hand(s).
When a player is in the act of shooting and after being fouled he/she passes the ball off, that player is no longer considered to have been in the act of shooting.

Goal: When made and its value
Definition: A goal is made when a live ball enters the basket from above and remains within or passes through the basket entirely.

The ball is considered to be within the basket when the slightest part of the ball is within the basket and below the level of the ring.

Rule: A goal is credited to the offensive team when the ball has entered as follows:
* A goal released from a free throw counts 1 point.
* A goal released from inside the arc (1-point field goal area) counts 1 point.
* A goal released from behind the arc (2-point field goal area) counts 2 points.

If a defensive player deflects a pass between the opponents' players or taps a ball away from an opponent's dribbling and the ball enters directly the basket, the goal shall count and it shall be awarded to the last offensive player in ball control.

If the last offensive player, when passing or dribbling the ball was in the
* 1-point field goal area, the goal shall count 1 point.
* 2-point field goal area, the goal shall count 2 points.

If a defensive player accidentally scores a field goal, the goal shall count and shall be assigned to the last offensive player in ball control.

If a defensive player deliberately scores a field goal, it is a violation and the goal shall not count. The game shall be resumed with a check-ball for the last offensive team.

In all situations where a defensive team establishes ball control and scores a goal without clearing the ball, the basket shall be cancelled as the team had not cleared the ball prior to the shot attempt including controlled taps. This shall include controlled taps.

If a player causes the entire ball to pass through the basket from below, it is a violation.

The game clock or the shot clock must show 0:00.3 (3 tenths of a second) or more for a player to gain control of the ball on a check-ball or on a rebound after the last free throw in order to attempt a shot for a field goal. If the game clock or the shot clock shows 0:00.2 or 0:00.1 the only type of a valid field goal made is by directly tapping the ball.

Check-ball
Definition: Possession of the ball given to either team following any dead ball situation shall start/resume with a check-ball, i.e. an exchange of the ball (between the defensive and offensive player) behind the arc at the top of the playing court.

Procedure: The offensive player taking the check-ball shall be behind the arc (neither of his feet is inside nor on the arc line) at the top of the playing court (facing the backboard).
The defensive player facing the offensive player shall hand over or bounce the ball to the opponent with a normal basketball pass allowing the offensive player to take control of the ball.

It shall be a reasonable distance (approx. 1 m) between the offensive and the defensive players taking the check-ball. In FIBA 3x3 Official Competitions at World level, the 3x3 infinity logo shall be used to position the defensive player and the offensive player at this distance (two opponents' players facing each other on each longer side of the logo, without touching it).

During the game, if the defensive and offensive players are in their correct positions, check-ball procedure requires no action from the referees. If the players are not in their correct position (or executing the check-ball incorrectly), the referee shall pass the ball directly to the defensive player to assure the check-ball is executed correctly.

At the beginning of the regular playing time or overtime the check-ball shall be administered by the referee.

Time-out
Definition: A time-out is an interruption of the game requested by a player or substitute to the referees.

Rule: Each team shall be granted 1 time-out.

In addition to the teams' time-outs, in FIBA 3x3 Official Competitions or if so decided by the organiser 2 additional TV time-outs that shall be granted at the first dead ball after the game clock shows 6:59 and 3:59 respectively in all games.

All time-outs shall last 30 seconds.

Both teams are entitled to request a time-out at a time-out opportunity.

A time-out opportunity begins when the ball becomes dead prior to a check-ball or free throw.

A time-out cannot be granted when the ball is live.

An unused time-out may be carried over to the overtime.

Substitution
Definition: A substitution is an interruption of the game requested by the substitute to become a player.

Rule: Both teams are entitled to request a substitution when the ball becomes dead prior to a check-ball or free throw.

Procedure: The substitute can enter the game without any prior notice to the referees or table officials while the ball is dead and the game clock is stopped.

The substitutions can only take place behind the endline and require no action from the referees or table officials.

If the free-throw shooter must be substituted because he:
* Is injured, or
* Has been disqualified,
the free throw(s) must be attempted by his substitute.

Game lost by forfeit
Rule: A team shall lose the game by forfeit if at the scheduled starting time of the game the team is not present on the playing court with 3 players ready to play. This rule shall not be mandatory for grassroots events.

Penalty: In case of forfeit, the game score is marked with w-O or O-w ("w" standing for win).
For the winning team this game result shall not be considered when calculating the team's average score while for the losing team this game result shall be considered with 0 points when calculating the team's average score.

A team losing by a tortuous forfeit shall be disqualified from the competition.

If during the (first) pool phase of a tournament the team forfeits for the second time or in case of no-show, the team shall be disqualified from the tournament and will not be ranked in the Final Standings of the tournament.

Game lost by default
Rule: A team shall lose a game by default if it leaves the court before the end of the game or all the players of the team are injured and/or disqualified.

Penalty: In case of a default, the winning team may choose to keep its score as it stands or to have the game forfeited, whilst the defaulting team's score is set to 0 in any case. In case of a default where the winning team choses to have the game forfeited, the game result shall not be considered when calculating the team's average score.

A team losing by default shall be disqualified from the competition.










VIOLATIONS

Violations
Definition: A violation is an infraction of the rules.

Penalty: The ball shall be awarded to the opponents for a check-ball.

Player out-of-bounds and ball out-of-bounds
Definition: A player is out-of-bounds when any part of his body is in contact with the floor, or any object other than a player above, on or outside the boundary line.

The ball is out-of-bounds when it touches:
* A player or any other person who is out-of-bounds.
* The floor or any object above, on or outside the boundary line.
* The backboard supports, the back of the backboards or any object above the playing court.

Rule: The ball is caused to go out-of-bounds by the last player to touch or be touched by the ball before it goes out-of-bounds, even if the ball then goes out-of-bounds by touching something other than a player.

If the ball is out-of-bounds because of touching or being touched by a player who is on or outside the boundary line, this player causes the ball to go out-of-bounds.

If a player(s) move(s) to out-of-bounds during a held ball, a jump ball situation occurs.

Dribbling
Definition: A dribble is the movement of a live ball caused by a player in control of that ball who throws, taps, rolls or bounces the ball on the floor.

A dribble starts when a player, having gained control of a live ball on the court throws, taps, rolls or bounces it on the court and touches it again before it touches another player.

A dribble ends when the player touches the ball with both hands simultaneously or permits the ball to come to rest in one or both hands.

During a dribble the player may not place any part of his/her hand under the ball and carry it from one point to another or bring the ball to a pause and then continue to dribble.

During a dribble the ball may be thrown into the air provided the ball touches the court or another player before the player who threw it touches it again with his hand.

There is no limit to the number of steps a player may take when the ball is not in contact with his hand.

A player who accidentally loses and then regains control of a live ball on the playing court is considered to be fumbling the ball.
The following are not dribbles:
* Successive shots for a field goal.
* Fumbling the ball at the beginning or at the end of a dribble.
* Attempts to gain control of the ball by tapping it from the vicinity of other players.
* Tapping the ball from the control of another player.
* Deflecting a pass and gaining control of the ball.
* Tossing the ball from hand to hand and allowing it to come to rest in one or both hands before touching the floor, provided that no travelling violation is commit-ted.
* Throwing the ball against the backboard and regaining the control of the ball.

Rule: A player shall not dribble for a second time after his first dribble has ended unless between the 2 dribbles he has lost control of a live ball on the playing court because of:
* A shot for a field goal.
* A touch of the ball by an opponent.
* A pass or fumble that has touched or been touched by another player.

Travelling
Definition: Travelling is the illegal movement of one foot or both feet beyond the limits outlined in this article, in any direction, while holding a live ball on the playing court.

A pivot is the legal movement in which a player who is holding a live ball on the playing court steps once or more than once in any direction with the same foot, while the other foot, called the pivot foot, is kept at its point of contact with the floor.

Rule: Establishing a pivot foot by a player who catches a live ball on the playing court:
* A player who catches the ball while standing with both feet on the floor:
- The moment one foot is lifted, the other foot becomes the pivot foot.
- To start a dribble, the pivot foot may not be lifted before the ball is released from the hand(s).
- To pass or shoot for a field goal, the player may jump off a pivot foot, but neither foot may be returned to the floor before the ball is released from the hand(s).
* A player who catches the ball while he is progressing, or upon completion of a dribble, may take two steps in coming to a stop, passing or shooting the ball:
- If, after receiving the ball, a player shall release the ball to start his dribble before his second step.
- The first step occurs when one foot or both feet touch the floor after gaining control of the ball.
- The second step occurs after the first step when the other foot touches the floor or both feet touch the floor simultaneously.
- If the player who comes to a stop on his first step has both feet on the floor or they touch the floor simultaneously, he may pivot using either foot as his pivot foot. If he then jumps with both feet, no foot may return to the floor before the ball is released from the hand(s).
— If a player lands with one foot he may only pivot using that foot.
- If a player jumps off one foot on the first step, he may land with both feet simultaneously for the second step. In this situation, the player may not pivot with either foot. If one foot or both feet then leave the floor, no foot may return to the floor before the ball is released from the hand(s).
- If both feet are off the floor and the player lands on both feet simultaneously, the moment one foot is lifted the other foot becomes the pivot foot.
- A player may not touch the floor consecutively with the same foot or both feet after ending his dribble or gaining control of the ball.
A player falling, lying or sitting on the floor:
* It is legal when a player falls and slides on the floor while holding the ball or, while lying or sitting on the floor, gains control of the ball.
* It is a violation if the player then rolls or attempts to stand up while holding the ball.

3 seconds
Rule: A player shall not remain in the restricted area for more than 3 consecutive seconds while his team is in control of a live ball and the game clock is running.

Allowances must be made for a player who:
* Makes an attempt to leave the restricted area.
* Is in the restricted area when he or his teammate is in the act of shooting and the ball is leaving or has just left the player's hand(s) on the shot for a field goal.
* Dribbles in the restricted area to shoot for a field goal after having been there for less than 3 consecutive seconds.

To establish himself outside the restricted area, the player must place both feet on the floor outside the restricted area.

5 seconds
Definition: A player who is holding a live ball on the playing court when an opponent is in an active legal guarding position at a distance of no more than 1 m must pass, shoot or dribble the ball within 5 seconds.

Back to the basket
Rule: An offensive player, after the ball has been cleared, shall not dribble inside the arc with his back or side to the basket for more than 3 consecutive seconds.

12 seconds
Rule: Stalling or failing to play actively (i.e. not attempting to score) shall be a violation.

Whenever:
* A player gains control of a live ball on the playing court,
* On a check-ball, the ball is in the hands of the offensive player after the check-ball has been completed,
* Following each successful field goal or last free throw, the ball is in the hands of the player from a non-scoring team,
that team must attempt a shot for a field goal within 12 seconds.

To constitute a shot for a field goal within 12 seconds:
* The ball must leave the player's hand(s) before the shot clock signal sounds, and
* After the ball has left the player's hand(s), the ball must touch the ring or enter the basket.
When a shot for a field goal is attempted near the end of the 12-second period and the shot clock signal sounds while the ball is in the air:
* If the ball enters the basket, no violation has occurred, the signal shall be disregarded and the goal shall count.
* If the ball touches the ring but does not enter the basket, no violation has occurred, the signal shall be disregarded and the game shall continue.
* If the ball misses the ring, a violation has occurred. However, if the opponents gain an immediate and clear control of the ball, the signal shall be disregarded and the game shall continue.

When the backboard is equipped with yellow lighting along its perimeter at the top, the lighting takes precedence over the shot clock signal sound.

All restrictions related to goaltending and interference shall apply.

If the court is not equipped with a shot clock and a team is not sufficiently trying to attack the basket, the referees shall give in last 5 seconds the offensive team an information on the remaining second by counting them loudly and signalling them with an extended arm.

Procedure: The shot clock shall be reset whenever the game is stopped by a referee:
* For a foul or violation (not for the ball having gone out-of-bounds) by the team not in control of the ball,
* For any valid reason by the team not in control of the ball.

In these situations, the possession of the ball shall be awarded to the same team that previously had control of the ball, the shot clock shall be reset to 12 seconds.

However, if the game is stopped by a referee for any valid reason not connected with either team the shot clock shall not be reset but shall continue from the time it was stopped, unless in the judgement of a referee, it would place that team at a disadvantage.

The shot clock shall be reset to 12 seconds whenever a check-ball is awarded to the opponents' team after the game is stopped by a referee for a foul or violation (including for the ball having gone out-of-bounds) committed by the team in control of the ball.

The shot clock shall also be reset to 12 seconds if the new offensive team is awarded a check-ball as a result of the jump ball situation.

Whenever the game is stopped by a referee for a technical foul committed by the team in control of the ball, the game shall be resumed with a check-ball. The shot clock shall not be reset but shall continue from the time it was stopped.

When the team is awarded a check-ball as part of the penalty for an unsportsmanlike or disqualifying foul, the shot clock shall be reset to 12 seconds.

After the ball has touched the ring of the basket, the shot clock shall be reset to 12 seconds, whenever any player gains control of the ball.
If the shot clock signal sounds in error while a team has control of the ball or neither team has control of the ball, the signal shall be disregarded, and the game shall continue.

However, if in the judgement of a referee, the team in control of the ball has been placed at a disadvantage, the game shall be stopped, the shot clock shall be corrected and possession of the ball shall be awarded to that team.

Clearing the ball
Definition: Clearing the ball is the way of play, which grants a new offensive team a possession of the ball form behind the arc to do its best to attempt a shot for a field goal.

Rule: Following each successful field goal or the last free throw (except those followed by ball possession):
* A player from a non-scoring team shall resume the game by dribbling or passing the ball from inside the court directly underneath the basket (not from behind the end line) to a place on the court behind the arc.
* The defensive player is not allowed to play for the ball in the "no-charge semicircle area" underneath the basket.

A player is considered to be "behind the arc" when neither of his feet is inside or on the arc line.

Following each unsuccessful field goal or last free throw (except those followed by ball possession):
* If the offensive player rebounds the ball, he may continue to attempt to score without returning the ball behind the arc.
* If the defensive player rebounds the ball, he must return the ball behind the arc (by passing or dribbling).

If the defensive team steals or blocks the ball, it must return the ball behind the ar (by passing or dribbling).

Penalty
If the ball leaves player hand(s) attempting a field-goal before it has been cleared, it is a "no-cleared ball" violation and potential field goal shall not count. The ball shall be awarded to the opponents for a check-ball.

Goaltending and Interference
Definition: A shot for a field goal or a free throw:
* Begins when the ball leaves the hand(s) of a player in the act of shooting.
* Ends when the ball:
- Enters the basket directly from above and remains within the basket or passes through the basket entirely.
-No longer has the possibility to enter the basket.
- Touches the ring.
- Touches the floor.
- Becomes dead.
Rule: Goaltending occurs during a shot for a field goal when a player touches the ball while it is completely above the level of the ring and:
* It is on its downward flight to the basket, or
* After it has touched the backboard.

Goaltending occurs during a shot for a free throw when a player touches the ball while it is in flight to the basket and before it touches the ring.

The goaltending restrictions apply until:
* The ball no longer has the possibility to enter the basket.
* The ball has touched the ring.

Interference occurs when:
* After a shot for a field goal or the last free throw a player touches the basket or the backboard while the ball is in contact with the ring.

After a free throw followed by an additional free throw(s), a player touches the ball, the basket or the backboard while there is still a possibility that the ball will enter the basket.
* A player reaches through the basket from below and touches the ball.
* A defensive player touches the ball or the basket while the ball is within the basket, thus preventing the ball from passing through the basket.
* A player causes the basket to vibrate or grasps the basket (ring and/or net) in such a way that causes the ball to take an unnatural bounce or to change direction, and the ball is prevented from entering the basket or is caused to enter the basket.
* A player grasps the basket and plays the ball.

When:
* A referee has blown his whistle while:
- The ball was in the hands of a player in the act of shooting, or
- The ball was in flight on a shot for a field goal or on a last free throw,
* The game clock signal has sounded for the end of the regular playing time,

No player shall touch the ball after it has touched the ring while it still has the possibility to enter the basket.

All restrictions related to goaltending and interference shall apply.

Penalty: If the violation is committed by an offensive player, no points can be awarded. The ball shall be awarded to the opponents for a check-ball.

If the violation is committed by a defensive player, the offensive team is awarded:
* 1 point, if the ball was released for a free throw.
1 point, if the ball was released from inside the arc (1-point field goal area).
* 2 points, if the ball was released from behind the arc (2-point field goal area).

The awarding of the points is considered as if the ball had entered the basket.
If the goaltending is committed by a defensive player during a last free throw, 1 point shall be awarded to the offensive team, followed by a technical foul penalty charged on the defensive player.

FOULS

Definition: A foul is an infraction of the rules concerning illegal personal contact with an opponent and/or unsportsmanlike behaviour.

Any number of fouls may be called on a team. Irrespective of the penalty, each foul shall be charged, entered on the scoresheet and penalised according to these rules.

Personal fouls are not entered on the scoresheet unless unsportsmanlike or disqualifying.

Contact: General principles
Cylinder principle: The cylinder principle is defined as the space within an imaginary cylinder occupied by a player on the floor. It includes the space above the player and is limited to:
* The front by the palms of the hands,
* The rear by the buttocks, and
* The sides by the outer edge of the arms and legs.

The hands and arms may be extended in front of the torso no further than the position of the feet, with the arms bent at the elbows so that the forearms and hands are raised. The distance between his feet will vary according to his height.

Principle of verticality
During the game, each player has the right to occupy any position (cylinder) on the playing court not already occupied by an opponent.

This principle protects the space on the floor which he occupies and the space above him when he jumps vertically within that space.

As soon as the player leaves his vertical position (cylinder) and body contact occurs with an opponent who had already established his own vertical position (cylinder), the player who left his vertical position (cylinder) is responsible for the contact.

The defensive player must not be penalised for leaving the floor vertically (within his cylinder) or having his hands and arms extended above him within his own cylinder.

The offensive player, whether on the floor or airborne, shall not cause contact with the defensive player in a legal guarding position by:
* Using his arms to create more space for himself (pushing off).
* Spreading his legs or arms to cause contact during or immediately after a shot for a field goal.

Legal guarding position
A defensive player has established an initial legal guarding position when:
* He is facing his opponent, and
* He has both feet on the floor.

The legal guarding position extends vertically above him (cylinder) from the floor to the ceiling. He may raise his arms and hands above his head or jump vertically but he must maintain them in a vertical position inside the imaginary cylinder.

Guarding a player who controls the ball
When guarding a player who controls (holding or dribbling) the ball, the elements of time and distance do not apply.

The player with the ball must expect to be guarded and must be prepared to stop or change his direction whenever an opponent takes an initial legal guarding position in front of him, even if this is done within a fraction of a second.

The guarding (defensive) player must establish an initial legal guarding position without causing contact before taking his position.

Once the defensive player has established an initial legal guarding position, he may move to guard his opponent, but he may not extend his arms, shoulders, hips or legs to prevent the dribbler from passing by him.

When judging a charge/block situation involving a player with the ball, a referee shall use the following principles:
* The defensive player must establish an initial legal guarding position by facing the player with the ball and having both feet on the floor.
* The defensive player may remain stationary, jump vertically, move laterally or backwards in order to maintain the initial legal guarding position.
* When moving to maintain the initial legal guarding position, one foot or both feet may be off the floor for an instant, as long as the movement is lateral or backwards, but not towards the player with the ball.
* Contact must occur on the torso, in which case the defensive player would be considered as having been at the place of contact first.
* Having established a legal guarding position, the defensive player may turn within his cylinder to avoid injury.

In any of the above situations, the contact shall be considered as having been caused by the player with the ball.

Guarding a player who does not control the ball
A player who does not control the ball is entitled to move freely on the playing court and take any position not already occupied by another player.

When guarding a player who does not control the ball, the elements of time and distance shall apply. A defensive player cannot take a position so near and/or so quickly in the path of a moving opponent that the latter does not have sufficient time or distance either to stop or change his direction.
The distance is directly proportional to the speed of the opponent, but never less than 1 normal step.

If a defensive player does not respect the elements of time and distance in taking his initial legal guarding position and contact with an opponent occurs, he is responsible for the contact.

Once a defensive player has established an initial legal guarding position, he may move to guard his opponent. He may not prevent him from passing by extending his arms, shoulders, hips or legs in his path. He may turn within his cylinder to avoid injury.

A player who is in the air
A player who has jumped into the air from a place on the playing court has the right to land again at the same place.

He has the right to land on another place on the playing court provided that the landing place and the direct path between the take-off and landing place is not already occupied by an opponent(s) at the time of take-off.

If a player has taken off and landed but his momentum causes him to contact an opponent who has taken a legal guarding position beyond the landing place, the jumper is responsible for the contact.

An opponent may not move into the path of a player after that player has jumped into the air.

Moving under a player who is in the air and causing contact is usually an unsportsmanlike foul and in certain circumstances may be a disqualifying foul.

Screening: Legal and illegal
Screening is an attempt to delay or prevent an opponent without the ball from reaching a desired position on the playing court.

Legal screening is when the player who is screening an opponent:
* Was stationary (inside his cylinder) when contact occurred
* Had both feet on the floor when contact occurred.

Illegal screening is when the player who is screening an opponent:
* Was moving when contact occurred.
* Did not give sufficient distance in setting a screen outside the field of vision of a stationary opponent when contact occurred.
* Did not respect the elements of time and distance of an opponent in motion when contact occurred.

If the screen is set within the field of vision of a stationary opponent (front or lateral), the screener may establish the screen as close to him as he wishes, provided there is no contact.
If the screen is set outside the field of vision of a stationary opponent, the screener must permit the opponent to take 1 normal step towards the screen without making contact.

If the opponent is in motion, the elements of time and distance shall apply. The screener must leave enough space so that the player who is being screened is able to avoid the screen by stopping or changing direction.

The distance required is never less than 1 and never more than 2 normal steps.

A player who is legally screened is responsible for any contact with the player who has set the screen.

Charging
Charging is illegal personal contact, with or without the ball, by pushing or moving into an opponent's torso.

Blocking
Blocking is illegal personal contact which impedes the progress of an opponent with or without the ball.

A player who is attempting to screen is committing a blocking foul if contact occurs when he is moving and his opponent is stationary or retreating from him.

If a player disregards the ball, faces an opponent and shifts his position as the opponent shifts, he is primarily responsible for any contact that occurs, unless other factors are involved.

The expression 'unless other factors are involved' refers to deliberate pushing, charging or holding of the player who is being screened.

It is legal for a player to extend his arm(s) or elbow(s) outside of his cylinder in taking position on the floor but they must be moved inside his cylinder when an opponent attempts to pass by. If the arm(s) or elbow(s) are outside his cylinder and contact occurs, it is blocking or holding.

A player attempting to screen shall commit a blocking foul if he puts his palms on his opponent, irrespectively of pushing or not, and/or holds or grabs his opponent.

No-charge semi-circle area
The no-charge semi-circle area is drawn on the playing court for the purpose of designating a specific area for the interpretation of charge/block situations under the basket.

On any penetration play into the no-charge semi-circle area any contact caused by an airborne offensive player with a defensive player inside the no-charge semi-circle shall not be called as an offensive foul, unless the offensive player is illegally using his hands, arms, legs or body. This rule applies when:
* The offensive player is in control of the ball whilst airborne, and
* He attempts a shot for a field goal or passes off the ball, and
* The defensive player has one foot or both feet in contact with the no-charge semi-circle area.

Contacting an opponent with the hand(s) and/or arm(s)
The touching of an opponent with the hand(s) is, in itself, not necessarily a foul with the exception of screening situations in which placing both palms on the opponent shall always be considered a foul.

The referees shall decide whether the player who caused the contact has gained an advantage. If contact caused by a player in any way restricts the freedom of movement of an opponent, such contact is a foul.

Illegal use of the hand(s) or extended arm(s) occurs when the defensive player is in a guarding position and his hand(s) or arm(s) is placed upon and remains in contact with an opponent with or without the ball, to impede his progress.

To repeatedly touch or jab' an opponent with or without the ball is a foul, as it may lead to rough play.

It is a foul by an offensive player with the ball to:
* 'Hook' or wrap an arm or an elbow around a defensive player in order to obtain an advantage.
* 'Push off' to prevent the defensive player from playing or attempting to play the ball, or to create more space for himself.
* Use an extended forearm or hand, while dribbling, to prevent an opponent from
gaining control of the ball.

It is a foul by an offensive player without the ball to 'push off' to:
* Get free to catch the ball.
* Prevent the defensive player from playing or attempting to play the ball.
* Create more space for him.

Post play
The principle of verticality (cylinder principle) applies also to post play

The offensive player in the post position and the defensive player guarding him must respect each other's rights to a vertical position (cylinder).

It is a foul by an offensive or defensive player in the post position to shoulder or hip his opponent out of position or to interfere with his opponent's freedom of movement using extended arms, shoulders, hips, legs or other parts of the body.

Illegal guarding from the rear

Illegal guarding from the rear is personal contact with an opponent, by a defensive player, from behind. The fact that the defensive player is attempting to play the ball does not justify his contact with an opponent from the rear.

Holding
Holding is illegal personal contact with an opponent that interferes with his freedom of movement. This contact (holding) can occur with any part of the body.

Pushing
Pushing is illegal personal contact with any part of the body where a player forcibly moves or attempts to move an opponent with or without the ball.

Fake being fouled
Fake is any action by a player to simulate that he has been fouled or to make theatrical exaggerated movements in order to create an opinion of being fouled and therefore gaining an advantage.

Contact foul
Definition: A contact foul is a player's illegal contact with an opponent, whether the ball is live or dead.

A player shall not hold, block, push, charge, trip or impede the progress of an opponent by extending his hand, arm, elbow, shoulder, hip, leg, knee or foot, nor by bending his body into an 'abnormal' position (outside his cylinder), nor shall he indulge in any rough or violent play.

Penalty: A contact foul shall be charged on the offender's team.

If the foul is committed on a player not in the act of shooting:
* The game shall be resumed with a check-ball by the non-offending team.
* If the offending team is in the team foul penalty situation, then Art. 41 shall apply. 2 free throws shall be awarded as of the 7th team foul.
* If the foul is committed on a player in the act of shooting, that player shall be awarded a number of free throws as follows:
* If the shot released from the field goal area is successful, the goal shall count and, in addition, 1 free throw. 2 free throws shall be awarded as of the 7th team foul.
* If the shot released from inside the arc is unsuccessful, 1 free throw. 2 free throws shall be awarded as of the 7th team foul.
* If the shot released from behind the arc is unsuccessful, 2 free throws.
* If the player is fouled as, or just before, the game clock signal sounds for the end of the regular playing time, or just before, the shot clock signal sounds, while the ball is still in the player's hand(s) and the field goal is successful, the goal shall not count and 1 or 2 free throws shall be awarded. 2 free throws shall be awarded as of the 7th team foul.

Double foul
Definition: A double foul is a situation in which 2 opponents commit contact fouls on each other at approximately the same time.
To consider 2 fouls as a double foul the following conditions must apply:
* Both fouls involve physical contact.
* Both fouls are between the same 2 opponents fouling each other.

Penalty: A contact foul shall be charged on each offender's team. No free throws shall be awarded irrespective of team foul situations or whether a foul is a player's first or second unsportsmanlike foul. The game shall be resumed as follows:
If at approximately the same time as the double foul:
* A valid field goal, or a last free throw is scored, the ball shall be awarded to the non-scoring team for a check-ball.
* A team had control of the ball or was entitled to the ball, the ball shall be awarded to this team for a check-ball. The shot-clock shall not be reset.
* Neither team had control of the ball nor was entitled to the ball, a jump ball situation occurs. The ball shall be awarded to the last defensive team with 12 seconds on the shot-clock.

Technical foul
Rules of conduct: The proper conduct of the game demands the full and loyal cooperation of the players and substitutes with the referees, table officials and sports supervisor, if present.

Each team shall do its best to secure victory, but this must be done in the spirit of sportsmanship and fair play.

Any deliberate or repeated non-cooperation or non-compliance with the spirit and intent of this rule shall be considered as a technical foul.

The referees may prevent technical fouls by giving warnings or even overlooking minor infractions which are obviously unintentional and have no direct effect upon the game, unless there is repetition of the same infraction after the warning.

If an infraction is recognised after the ball becomes live, the game shall be stopped and a technical foul charged. The penalty shall be administered as if the technical foul had occurred at the time it is charged. Whatever occurred during the interval between the infraction and the game being stopped shall remain valid.

Definition: A technical foul is a non-contact foul of a behavioural nature including, but not limited to:
* Disregarding warnings given by referees.
* Disrespectfully dealing and/or communicating with the referees, the sports supervisor, the table officials or the opponents.
* Using language or gestures likely to offend or incite the spectators.
Baiting and taunting an opponent.
* Obstructing the vision of an opponent by waving/placing his hand(s) near his eyes.
Excessive swinging of elbows.
* Delaying the game by:
- deliberately touching the ball or preventing the new offensive team from collecting the ball immediately after the ball passes through the basket on the successful field goal or free throw,
- deliberately not collecting the ball immediately without being prevented by the defensive team after the ball passes through the basket on the successful field goal or free throw,
- playing active defense inside the semi-circle after successful field goal or free throw,
- preventing a check-ball or a free throw from being taken promptly.
* Fake being fouled or exaggerating contact.
* Goaltending during the last free throw by a defensive player. The offensive team shall be awarded 1 point, followed by the technical foul penalty charged on the defensive team.
* Inappropriate interaction with people outside the playing court or any form of communication between players and coaches during the game.

A team member shall not be disqualified for the remainder of the game when he is charged with 2 technical fouls.

Penalty: A technical foul shall count as a team foul.
The opponents shall be awarded 1 free throw. The game shall be resumed as follows:
* The free throw shall be administered immediately. After the free throw, the check-ball shall be administered by the team which had control of the ball or was entitled to the ball when the technical foul was called.

* The free throw shall also be administered immediately, regardless whether the order of any other possible penalties for any other fouls has been determined or whether the administration of the penalties has been started. After the free throw for a technical foul, the game shall be resumed by the team which had control of the ball or was entitled to the ball when the technical foul was called with a check-ball.

If a valid field goal, or a last free throw is scored, the game shall be resumed with a check-ball for the last defensive team.

If neither team had control of the ball nor was entitled to the ball, a jump ball situation occurs. The game shall be resumed with a check-ball for the last defensive team.

Unsportsmanlike foul
Definition: An unsportsmanlike foul is a contact foul with an excessive, hard or dangerous contact.

Holding an opponent in control of the ball shall be considered as an unsportsmanlike foul.
The referees must interpret the unsportsmanlike fouls consistently throughout the game and to judge only the action.

Penalty: An unsportsmanlike foul shall be charged on the offender.
The first unsportsmanlike foul of a player shall be penalized with 2 free throws, no ball possession. If the first unsportsmanlike foul of a player is committed on a player in the act of shooting and the goal is made, it shall count and in addition 2 free throws shall be awarded.
The second unsportsmanlike foul of a player shall be penalized with 2 free throws and ball possession. If the second unsportsmanlike foul of a player is committed on a player in the act of shooting and the goal is made, it shall count and in addition 2 free throws and ball possession shall be awarded.

All unsportsmanlike fouls are counted as 2 fouls for team foul purposes.

A player shall be disqualified for the remainder of the game when he is charged with 2 unsportsmanlike fouls.

If a player is disqualified under Art. 37.2.5 (charged with 2 unsportsmanlike fouls), that unsportsmanlike foul shall be the only foul to be penalised and no additional penalty for the disqualification shall be administered.

Disqualifying foul
Definition: A disqualifying foul is any flagrant unsportsmanlike action by players or substitutes.

Violence
Acts of violence may occur during the game, contrary to the spirit of sportsmanship and fair play. These should be stopped immediately by the referees and, if necessary, by public order enforcement officers.

Whenever acts of violence occur involving players on the playing court or in its vicinity, the referees shall take the necessary action to stop them.

Any of the above persons who are guilty of flagrant acts of aggression on opponents or referees shall be disqualified. The referees report the incident to the organising body of the competition.

Public order enforcement officers may enter the playing court only if requested to do so by the referees. However, should spectators enter the playing court with the obvious intention of committing acts of violence, the public order enforcement officers must intervene immediately to protect the teams and referees.

All areas beyond the playing court or its vicinity, including entrances, exits, hallways, dressing rooms, etc., come under the jurisdiction of the organising body of the competition and the public order enforcement officers.

Physical actions by players or substitutes, which could lead to damaging of game equipment, must not be permitted by the referees.

When behaviour of this nature is observed by the referees, the offending team shall be given a warning.

Should the action(s) be repeated, a technical or even disqualifying foul shall immediately be called on the individual(s) involved.
Penalty: A disqualifying foul shall be charged on the offender.
Whenever the offender is disqualified according to the respective articles of these rules, he shall leave the court.
2 free throws shall be awarded:
* To any opponent in case of a non-contact foul,
* To the player who was fouled in case of a contact foul, followed by a check-ball.

All disqualifying fouls shall count as 2 fouls for team foul purposes.

Fighting
Definition: Fighting is physical interaction between 2 or more opponents (players, substitutes).

This article only applies to the substitutes who leave the confines of the team bench area during a fight or during any situation which may lead to a fight.

Rule: Substitutes, who leave the team bench area during a fight, or during any situation which may lead to a fight, shall be disqualified. However, if a substitute leaves the team bench area to assist the referees to maintain or restore the order, a substitute shall not be disqualified.

If a substitute leaves the team bench area and neither assists nor attempts to assist the referees to maintain or to restore order, the substitute shall be disqualified.

Penalty: If team members of both teams are disqualified under this article and there are no other foul penalties remaining for administration, the game shall be resumed as follows.

All possible foul penalties on players on the playing court involved in a fight or any situation which leads to a fight, shall be dealt with in accordance with Art. 42.

Team fouls: Penalty
Definition: A team foul is a personal, technical, unsportsmanlike or disqualifying foul committed by a player or substitute. A team is in the team foul penalty situation after it has committed 6 team fouls.

* Consistency in the application of common sense to each game, bearing in mind the abilities of the players concerned and their attitude and conduct during the game.
* Consistency in the maintenance of a balance between game control and game flow, having a 'feeling' for what the participants are trying to do and calling what is right for the game.

Only a score and/or a call by the referees can be challenged. A no-call not leading to a score cannot be challenged. The situations when a Challenge may be requested by a team during the game are as follows (exhaustive list):
* Verify whether a successful shot was released before or after the shot clock expired.
* Identify the player who caused the ball to go out-of-bounds when such violation is called in the last 2 minutes of the regular playing time or when a team has reached 19 or more points or in the overtime of a game.

If the Challenge is not requested the next time the team has gained possession after the situation occurred or at the first dead ball after the situation occurred, the Challenge request shall be refused.

If after the review the referee's decision is confirmed and it remains unchanged ("Challenge lost"), the team shall lose its Challenge right for the remainder of the game.

If after the review the referee's decision is corrected and changed ("Challenge won"), the team shall retain its Challenge right for the remainder of the game.

If the video material is not clear, the referee's decision shall remain unchanged and the team shall retain its Challenge right for the remainder of the game.
The referees shall have the power to make decisions on any point not specifically covered by these rules.

Should a protest be filed by one of the teams, the referees (if no sports supervisor is present) shall, upon receipt of the protest reasons, report in writing the incident to the organising body of the competition.

If a referee is injured or for any other reason cannot continue to perform his duties within 5 minutes of the incident, the game shall be resumed.
